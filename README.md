# SelfAggregation
Collection of f-plane cloud-resolving model data used to study convective self-aggregation and tropical cyclogenesis by Carstens and Wing (2020, 2022). This repository contains model input parameters as plain text files for a series of simulations using the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM), developed by Marat Khairoutdinov at Stony Brook University. It also contains daily-averaged data in standardized netCDF format from the SAM simulations used to generate the results in Carstens and Wing (2022), which will be described below. Additional data relevant to tropical cyclogenesis will be added at a later date, and is available upon request.
